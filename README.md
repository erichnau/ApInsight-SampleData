# ApInsight - SampleData

## Introduction
This repository contains some sample datasets that can be used with the ApInsight tool. It is intended for users that do not have own GPR datasets processed with the ApRadar software (Geosphere Austria) but want to explore the functionality of ApInsight.  

The datasets provided are minimal examples of data needed for analysis with ApInsight and contain processed 3D datablocks in a customized .fld file format and corresponding digital terrain models in .tif (geotif) format.
